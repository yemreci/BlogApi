# BlogApi
 Basic Web API blog project that uses React for front-end
 I created the project to understand Web API's.
 This is a basic Blog API that is consumed by React UI.
 Edit Database connection string in appsettings if you wish to use project.
 User authentication and authorization will be added later, parts of the code related to it does not work as intended as of now.
